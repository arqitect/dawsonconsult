                <li><strong>Chris Dawson <em><u>really is</u></em> a senior trusted advisor with 35 years experience</strong> providing value for individuals, teams and organizations. It’s not just a marketing claim.
                    <ul class="alt-bullet">
                        <li>Many of our clients have repeatedly returned to us when a new set of challenges has arisen.</li>
                        <li>Almost all of our business is word-of-mouth from former clients who want to share the value they received with an executive friend or colleague.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="padding-top: 12px;"><strong>What does 35 years experience give you?</strong>
                    <ul class="alt-bullet">
                        <li>Navigating personal, team and organizational privacy boundaries is complex and requires mature judgment based on experience and full commitment to maintaining those boundaries, sometimes in the face of pressure from above to violate individual privacy.</li>
                        <li>We take confidentiality seriously. Everyone says this, of course, but maintaining it in political, competitive environments takes mature experience and a firm backbone. Coaching is not therapy in the sense that the organization has a legitimate claim on the outcome of a coaching intervention. Establishing trust inside and outside of the coaching relationship allows us to navigate these boundaries in ways that all stakeholders see as a win and high value-add.</li>
                        <li>Knowing how to modulate feedback so that it has the highest probability of acceptance is both a science and art. Our clients would call this out as a true ‘super-power’ of Chris’. He has a gift for conveying feedback in a way that is truthful, evidence-based and motivating – whether in the coaching or assessment sphere.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="padding-top: 12px;"><strong>We have helped numerous CEO’s to be successful in complex, challenging environments</strong> with their board, a new strategy, an under-performing team, aligning culture with strategy.  Few executives know how to create and shape a high-performance team; perhaps the single most impactful capability that can create organizational tail-winds but also powerful head-winds when the top leadership team is not working together effectively.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 12px;"><strong>Assessment is serious business</strong> and we are ever-mindful of how our conclusions about people have great value, but may also be harmful,  if not accurate and skillfully articulated. Any conclusion we draw from an assessment has multiple data points to support it. Clients speak of high value add coming from the insights both our Coaching and Executive Assessments provide.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 12px;"><strong>Our fees reflect both our high-value and low overhead.</strong> We always create a proposed work plan that articulates clear outcomes and timeframes for the work we do. Proposals often outline a menu of choices set for different outcomes and cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 24px;">Dawson Consulting Group is, at the moment, Chris Dawson and likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.</div>
