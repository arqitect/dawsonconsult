            <div class="content-title" style="padding-top: 48px;">What Our Clients Say About Us</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Dawson Consulting Group has done a great job partnering with us to take our leadership programs to the next level. Their people and methods are top-notch, and they consistently look to add value year after year. They are professional, seasoned, and senior partners for us. - I'd recommend them highly.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Andy Billings, VP Profitability & EA University - <strong>Electronic Arts</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Dawson Consulting Group was invaluable in coaching our senior executives through a difficult culture change. They have a collection of tools, method and expertise that allowed to customize in several global geographies, but saved us the time of reinventing best practices that they had readily available.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Richard Dahl  Former President & Chief Operating Officer, <strong>Dole Food Company</strong>, Inc. & former Chairman <strong>CEO James Campbell Company</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Dawson [Consulting Group] did great work in helping us toward building and optimizing a better functioning executive team. They helped us create the additional tools we needed to grow to the next level. We found Chris to be a seasoned, experienced professional, who dealt effectively with challenges and created valuable guidelines that provided us with a roadmap to higher performance levels, he did so efficiently and effectively. Highly recommended.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Bob Hagerty, former Chairman and CEO, <strong>Polycom now Poly, Inc</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris Dawson and his consulting team helped me successfully identify and develop the organizational capabilities that the company needed during a critical transition time. He and his colleagues at Dawson Consulting Group provided an invaluable service and I'd recommend them to anyone who is serious about building organizational capabilities that provide sustainable competitive advantage</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Scott Kaspick former Chairman and CEO, <strong>Kaspick & Co. (now part of TIAA-Cref)</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris Dawson worked with me, as both an individual and executive team coach, over the last couple years at Jewish Hospital and St.Mary's HealthCare. Chris interweaves individual and team issues, aligning both with the business and strategy imperatives, in a highly effective way that creates true value for the organization. The work he did with us was intense, yet highly professional, and always respectful of privacy boundaries. Chris did a terrific job and I would recommend him highly to any executive team that wanted to elevate its performance level - whether stuck, in disarray, or wanting to stretch to high performance. As healthcare organizations across the country must re-invent themselves to prepare for healthcare reform, so then must the executives leading those organizations. Chris's approach and expertise would be of benefit to any healthcare executive team seeking to improve its effectiveness.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Tom Gessel, former CEO <strong>St Mary’s Healthcare, current CEO at Asante</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris Dawson and I have worked together for more than 10 years, first at VISA and more recently at Advent Software. Chris is one of those true professionals that I’ve seen handle sensitive and complex organizational situations with finesse and integrity. He is a master executive coach with the ability to describe and then communicate development areas to senior executives in ways which motivate them to change. He also has a great skill in corralling a team of independent executives to break down the silos for a common mission. Whatever the formal assignment at the outset, he quickly grasps the bigger picture to navigate through complicated waters and take the right actions to add value. I have seen Chris operate in multiple cultures and he adapts well in different situations. I would (and have) definitely hire Chris again.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>John Brennan, former <strong>VP HR, Visa International, VP HR Advent Software.</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">I've gone through two detailed performance review / executive coaching sessions with Chris over a 4 year period. It's been a highly illuminating and rewarding experience. Chris won't pull any punches, but his advice will be specific and actionable. His reviews are data-driven at the core, but also have a critical layer of human intelligence and sensitivity based on his experience. His process is well-worth the effort.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Will Clemens, former VP Marketing & Sales <strong>Advent Software, current CEO at Progress Learning</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris played a vital role for our Core Team during our worldwide implementation of Oracle Applications. This project covered 10 sites around the globe and involved team members within our recently merged companies. The Core Team was a dynamic and aggressive group with strong personalities and huge pressures to get the project done succeffully. Chris helped us define and refine our team processes, drive a better understanding of team dynamics and helped us all to realize how our styles impacted the other team members. The project was very successful and Chris had a lot to do with that success</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Michael Jones, former Senior Director (Global Professional Services) Portfolio Risk Manager at <strong>Salesforce. Former CIO at Quantum Hard Disk</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Strong tools, great experience, brilliant - that's sort of par for the course. What makes Dawson different is that they are insightful, brilliant senior people who deliver their ideas in a way that made me use them. And guess what? They worked!</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em><strong>VP HR, Applied Signal Technology </strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">The Dawson Consulting Group have gotten to know us in such a way that they actually see us more clearly than we see ourselves in numerous areas. We have used them off and on for over 20 years in a way that is rare in this day of consulting fads and fashions. They are truly the senior 'trusted advisors' that they seem to be and I'd recommend them wholeheartedly. We used them for everything from pre-hire assessments of new hires to departmental team building, succession planning and enterprise culture change.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>David Carey, former CEO & chairman <strong>Outrigger Enterprise Hotels</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Without Dawson's help around designing and orchestrating our strategy process, I can safely say we would not be where we are today. He has helped us put in place the infrastructure capabilities that we needed to grow from $20mm to $100mm in just three short years.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Greg Love, former CEO, <strong>MicroScan ( now Omron) and MicroPower</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris Dawson added tremendous value to Dow and was a terrific partner and trusted advisor to me during the period when I was SVP of Human Resources, Marketing and Public Affairs. He helped us set up a best-practices in Executive On-Boarding capability and then successfully helped over 30 executives assimilate into our complex culture during a difficult period in our history. He is a very seasoned, senior level executive leadership coach and team builder who skillfully navigated some complicated organizational and political dynamics to create win/win solutions. I strongly recommend him.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Julie Fasone-Holder, EVP Administration, <strong>Dow Chemical Company</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris Dawson did a terrific job of helping us manage a very tough organizational transition during a critical IT implementation project at City of Hope. He moves effectively between individual, team and enterprise cultural dynamics - striking the right balance between stability and constructive change. Chris is an absolute professional who handled some complicated political situations with professionalism and skill - calling out difficult truths that needed to surface in an honest and constructive way. What is unusual about his consulting style is the breadth and depth of his consulting competencies. In his several engagements with us he did some great individual coaching, some team development while also helping move the culture in the direction we needed to go.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Virginia Opipare, <strong>former COO City of Hope, current CEO Central New York Care Collaborative</strong></em></div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 36px;">Chris Dawson is great! I worked with Chris on a number of challenging organizational issues and I expect I will work with him many more times. Chris understands people and organizations exceptionally well. He has decades of experience working with all types of individuals, teams, cultures and managers. His approach and tools raise self-awareness, team-awareness and clarity. He builds high levels of trust and confidence with all involved and ensures that crucial conversations take place. Chris provides great counsel and makes valuable contributions.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-left: 24px;"><em>Dan Nye, <strong>former President LinkedIn and SVP Advent Software.</strong></em></div>
            


            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 12px;">Chris Dawson has served as a subject matter expert coaching top leaders in three key areas: Strategy Making and Execution,  Team and Individual Leadership and Culture Change. In times past Chris has had a team that would serve as an outsourced capability to come in and <u>do those things</u> that the client did not have bandwidth or expertise to do themselves. Dawson Consulting is just Chris Dawson at present.</div>
