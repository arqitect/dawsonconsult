            <div class="content-title">Executive Coaching</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 24px;">Coaching these days can mean a wide range of consulting activity.</div>
            <ul class="content-bullet-container" style="padding-top: 12px; padding-left: 62px;">
                <li>Executives in leadership positions may need a subject matter expert to guide them in an area in which they are unfamiliar. Even experienced leaders may not have faced a change in strategy or culture; a merger/acquisition; a dysfunctional team, a critical Board.</li>
                <li>The top leader – irrespective of the title CEO, President, C-Something– rarely have a neutral party they can be truly ‘vulnerable with’ which is very different than the alliances they would have with peers, Board or subordinate team members. The Board’s job is to represent shareholders and evaluate the CEO’s performance. In the downward direction the CEO has a team who is accountable and evaluated for their performance by him or her. It is structurally a lonely job.</li>
                <li>Every serious leader should be aware of shortcomings and value an honest but supportive voice – not likely someone on the top team or the Board.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 0px;">Chris Dawson has served as a subject matter expert coaching top leaders in three key areas: Strategy Making and Execution,  Team and Individual Leadership and Culture Change. In times past Chris has had a team that would serve as an outsourced capability to come in and <u>do those things</u> that the client did not have bandwidth or expertise to do themselves. Dawson Consulting is just Chris Dawson at present.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 12px;">Chris has also been a coach for top leaders who wish to work on acquisition of leadership skills and competencies, or mitigation of personal traits that are self-defeating. No leader is good at everything. People’s core personality will always make them great at some things, okay at others, and not-okay at a few. The leader who doesn’t have an inventory of their own skills and a plan to improve them is taking on considerable risk for their overall success. A frequent focus of Executive Coaching is the person who has just been promoted into a big, new job for which they are only partially prepared for.</div>
            <div class="content-text" style="padding-top: 12px;">We <em>always</em> structure executive coaching engagements with the following basic framework:</div>
            <ul class="content-bullet-container" style="padding-left: 62px;">
                <li>We are explicit with the client about the focus of the coaching. What is the coaching going to produce in terms of some improvement for the executive.
                    <ul class="alt-bullet">
                        <li>How will we measure success?</li>
                        <li>What the tempo of the coaching will be</li>
                        <li>Typically a six-month timeframe, with option to end or re-contract</li>
                        <li>Typically 1x/week meetings – though not always</li>
                        <li>Usually an initial assessment and 360 in some form</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Explicit and transparent agreements about confidentiality and what will be reported outside of the coaching relationship.
                    <ul class="alt-bullet">
                        <li>Usually a kick-off and closing 3-way meeting with executive and his or her manager</li>
                        <li>Confidentiality re: any personal revelations. Issues that Chris believes should not remain unspoken, will typically be conveyed by the executive to whomever is appropriate – often the direct superior. Chris does not report outside of the coaching relationship other than what has been agreed to with the executive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
